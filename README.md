# üè° Mortgage Computation Package

This package encapsulates the mortgage loan processing logic of the Homeful platform. It manages everything from borrower evaluation to monthly amortization, income requirements, and cash-out computations. The design is modular, chainable, and test-driven.

## Installation

```
composer require homeful/mortgage
```

---

## ‚ú® Features Overview

- **Encapsulated `Mortgage` Class**: Central to processing and configuring a mortgage loan.
- **Modular Traits**: Responsibilities are split across focused, reusable traits.
- **Supports Add-on & Deductible Fees**: MRI, Fire Insurance, Consulting, Processing fees, etc.
- **Dynamic GMI & PV-based Eligibility**: Computes present value from disposable income.
- **Test-driven**: Includes comprehensive real-world loan scenarios with expected outputs.
- **Fluent API**: Chainable configuration methods (`setX()->setY()`).

## üîß Trait Responsibilities

### üî¢ Financial Computation
- `HasContractPrice`: Manages TCP (Total Contract Price)
- `HasDownPayment`: Computes down payment and amortization
- `HasMiscellaneousFees`: Additional fees (computed or set)
- `HasMultipliers`: Interest rates, income multipliers
- `HasTerms`: Manages loan balance terms

### üí∏ Cash Flow Management
- `HasCashOuts`: Abstract layer for any outgoing cash items
- `HasAddOnFeesToLoanAmortization`: Adds MRI & Fire Insurance to monthly amortization

### üë• Parties
- `HasProperty`: Assigns & syncs `Property` instance
- `HasBorrower`: Assigns borrower & GMI rules

### üéÅ Promotions
- `HasPromos`: Low-cash-out promo logic
- `isPromotional()`: Detects promotional packages

### ‚öôÔ∏è Static Config
- `HasConfig`: Reads default term, interest rate, borrower age from config

---

## üßÆ Computation Flow

1. **Validation**: Inputs validated using Laravel validator
2. **Defaults**: Loaded from `Property` and `Borrower` if not provided
3. **Processing**:
    - Down Payment
    - Balance Payment
    - Miscellaneous Fees
    - Cash Outs
    - Loan Details (term, interest, income requirement)

### üîç Formula Highlights

- **Balance Payment** = TCP ‚Äì Down Payment
- **Loan Principal** = Balance Payment + Balance Misc. Fees
- **Loan Amortization** = Payment + (MRI + Fire Insurance if applicable)

---

## ‚úÖ Eligibility Tools

- `getLoanDifference()`: Checks if borrower can afford based on income
- `getPresentValueFromMonthlyDisposableIncomePayments()`: PV computation using borrower income
- `getJointBorrowerDisposableMonthlyIncome()`: Computes combined disposable income

---

## üß™ Tests Included

- Fee configuration & validation
- Various mortgage packages (sample use cases)
- Income requirement matching
- Loan difference computation
- Cash-out validations
- Event handling

---

## üß† Design Insights

- **Event Driven**: Traits dispatch events on update
- **Chainable API**: Fluent configuration methods
- **Precision Math**: Uses `Brick\Money` + `Whitecube\Price`
- **Compliance Ready**: Validates ranges for fees, DP, terms
- **Fully Tested**: Aligns with `PMT`, `PV` financial functions for accuracy

---

## üîó Key Integrations

- `Homeful\Payment\Payment`: Loan logic & computation
- `Homeful\Property\Property`: Provides TCP, MF %, etc.
- `Homeful\Borrower\Borrower`: Age, income, region
- `Homeful\Common\Classes`: Shared value object helpers

---

## Usage

Here's a basic usage example to simulate a mortgage package:

```php
use Homeful\Mortgage\Mortgage;
use Homeful\Borrower\Borrower;
use Homeful\Property\Property;
use Homeful\Common\Classes\Input;
use Homeful\Mortgage\Data\MortgageData;
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;
use Whitecube\Price\Price;
use Brick\Money\Money;

$tcp = 2500000;
$params = [
    Input::WAGES => 50000,
    Input::TCP => $tcp,
    Input::PERCENT_DP => 5 / 100,
    Input::DP_TERM => 12,
    Input::BP_INTEREST_RATE => 7 / 100,
    Input::PERCENT_MF => 8.5 / 100,
    Input::LOW_CASH_OUT => 0.0,
    Input::BP_TERM => 20,
];

$property = (new Property)
    ->setTotalContractPrice(Price::of($tcp, 'PHP'))
    ->setAppraisedValue(Price::of($tcp, 'PHP'));

$borrower = (new Borrower($property))
    ->setBirthdate(Carbon::parse('1999-03-17'))
    ->setGrossMonthlyIncome($params[Input::WAGES]);

$mortgage = new Mortgage(property: $property, borrower: $borrower, params: $params);
$data = MortgageData::fromObject($mortgage);

dd($data->toArray());
```

This will output a complete array of all derived mortgage values like down payment, amortizations, loan amount, income requirement, and more.

### Test Coverage

### Summary

This package is intended to act as the core engine for mortgage calculators, simulators, and affordability evaluators in housing or real estate applications.

Sample test cases cover:

- Varying down payment terms
- Configurable miscellaneous fees
- Contract price changes
- Mortgage variations by market segments (e.g. ECONOMIC)
- Income-based qualification scenarios
- Present value evaluations based on borrower‚Äôs disposable income

Behold, a new you awaits ‚Äì with well-structured mortgage processing üè°‚ú®
